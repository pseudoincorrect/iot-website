It took place in a research project aiming at predicting the hydration level of multiple persons with a low-cost, low power and easily scalable system. In the context of the World Cup Happening in Qatar in 2022, the Qatari government encouraged the emergence of projects, that aimed to an increase of the well-being of the construction employees working outdoor, sometime under high temperatures and humidity conditions. One of the answer we came up with, was to <b>provide a low-budget, long range monitoring system for these particular persons, based on wireless mesh network</b>.</p>",
      "details": "<em><b> Now, for the practical part: </b></em><p>We are developing a custom wrist-mounted device, RF enabled, that integrates into a low-power Mesh network ( <b> OpenThread </b> ). All Bio data are sent to our server hosting a <b> full stack application </b> (backend/database and front end). This <b> system is easily scalable </b> so hundreds of companies can monitor the health status of hundreds of their employees.&nbsp;</p><em><br /> <b> Overall Behavior and Hierarchy of the system:</b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></em><p><b>Each person is wearing a custom smart wristwatch </b> that contains essentially two <b> temperature sensors </b> (on for the skin and one for the ambient temperature, one <b> hear rate / oximetry sensor </b> (oxygen level), and one <b> dehydration sensor </b> (that is still under development with our research team). Each of these devices is transmitting and listening data from the RF low-power network they are authenticated to, at regular intervals. The network is created by a set of routers that relay the sensor data to a gateway, which is a router connected to a board computer with an internet access. This <b> RF mesh network protocol </b> is the <b> OpenThread </b> implementation, for low-power, (relatively) high bandwidth and latency, and robustness. This Gateway, send data to our <b> backend application, hosted online </b> , with a by <b> directional communication </b> . That way, our server online can received and send data to each node. Finally we designed a frontend application (website) that can display all of these data and control the overall behavior of the system. Moreover, this system integrate user authentication, meaning that we can easily scale this system up, so that many different company can have their own sets of wristwatch/routers/gateway and access their data online, securely, as we are using the latest security technologies, both for the online server, the mesh network and the hardware.&nbsp;</p><em><br /> <b> The breakdown of the project's components (and codes):&nbsp; </b></em><ul><li><b> Wrist-mounted device </b> (wristwatch), containing sensors and wireless chip for the mesh network communication, battery powered, with a firmware written in C. This system is custom made by our team, which concerns both the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and the wristwatch bracelet (3D printed with hard and soft materials).&nbsp;</li><li><b> Mesh Router device </b> (plugged to a wall socket) containing a wireless chip with a power amplifier (firmware written in C as well). This system is also custom made (PCB, and 3D printed case).&nbsp;</li><li><b> Mesh Gateway device </b> with the same component as the Router above; it role is entirely different as It is the interface between our mesh network and the single board computer, with which they communicate via a serial connection (C programming).&nbsp;</li><li><b> Gateway device </b> , which is a single board computer running a NodeJS daemon program, which make the link between our full-stack application and the Mesh network (JavaScript).&nbsp;</li><li><b> Backend server application </b> , Which consists into a REST API coupled with a Database. We used NodeJS with Express and MongoDB. This application was written in JavaScript.&nbsp;</li><li><b> Frontend Application </b> (hosted by the backend server) that uses the Angular framework (Typescript/ JavaScript).&nbsp; <br /> The 6 above parts are 6 independents programs and physical devices (except for the frontend application and backend server that are run on online servers).&nbsp;</li></ul>",

The base station connected to the PC was containing the same Nordic Semi chip along with a UART/USB interfacing chip. The data were then displayed on the PC. By the architecture of our system, we could connect as many node to the base station as the Bluetooth bandwidth would allow, which represents hundreds of nodes, as each node only transmit few times per minutes (which is selectable). The system is bidirectional, meaning that the Base station could send notifications/warning to the embedded system and vice versa.

A Research set up a protocol to analyze the different reaction of bacterial solution exposed to light with multiple wavelength. For this reason, we designed a rectangular paned including LEDs, controller, and microcontroller and power supply</p><i>Automated pumping system</i><p>One of our college experimentation implied that solution rich in nitrate was injected at regular intervals into a larger bacterial solution. To do so, we (rapidly) developed a systems controlling our pump and displaying the necessary information on a screen.</p><i>Line following robot with TTL logic</i><p>In order to introduce our undergrads students to Digital Systems and Electronic, we build a set&nbsp; of lab around a line following robot. In my particular case, I designed the robot out of TTL logic components and light emitter/receiver sensor (Led and photodiode).</p><i>Line following robot with Arm Microcontroller</i><p>Although this project looks like the one above, I set up a race competition for high school student during our University holiday to introduce them happily to Computer Sciences. Thus I built with them around 15 line following robot, this time controlled by a Microcontroller (MCU) in order to simplify the implementation (and keep them interested). For this we used 3 different MCU technologies: STM32, and Arduino.</p><i>Bluetooth BLE connection for remote sensors and python logger</i><p>For this project a student wanted help on how to link sensors to a computer wirelessly and without much complexity. Therefore we headed to an Arduino + serial Bluetooth connection with a simple python script to log data on a computer.</p><i>Smart composter design only</i><p>The goal of this project was to design a &ldquo;smart composter&rdquo; that would be used to monitor the degradation of alimentary product. It consisted mainly into linking sensor to a data logger, and to control the composter in term of temperature, humidity (by injecting water) and rotating a helix to move the processed food inside the composter, the student is currently implementing our solution.</p>",

The goal was to <b>improve the chain process of a manufacturing workstation</b>.
